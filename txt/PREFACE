You must login with a username and password. If you have not already
created one, you should do so by generating one and adding it to the
Hulk passwd file in /opt/hulk/passwd. To generate a user/password
key/pair, use:

 $ /opt/hulk/genpass myusername

It will prompt for a password. Inspect it first to confirm it is
correct. To write it to the passwd file use

 $ /opt/hulk/genpass myusername >> /opt/hulk/passwd

And configure your IRC client to use your username and to send a
*server* password.
